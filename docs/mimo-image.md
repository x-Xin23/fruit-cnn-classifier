﻿# Image Understanding

The image understanding model can answer based on the images you provide, supporting both image URL and Base64 encoding as input methods, and is suitable for scenarios such as image description and classification. 

## Quick Start

<div className='mdx-highlight'>

Note：For preparations such as obtaining an API Key, please refer to [First API Call](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/docs/quick-start/first-api-call).

</div>

Quickly experience the effect of image understanding by passing the model through the image URL method. The sample code is as follows.

## Supported models

Currently, only the `mimo-v2.5`, `mimo-v2-omni` models are supported.

## Image Input Method

Supported ways to upload images are as follows:

- Image URL Input: A publicly accessible image URL address must be provided. 

- Base64 Encoding Input: Convert the image to a Base64-encoded string before passing it in.

### Image URL Input

Directly pass in the image via the publicly accessible image URL, which is suitable for scenarios where the image is already stored in a publicly accessible environment. The file size of a single image cannot exceed 50 MB.

### Base64 Encoded Input

Convert the image file to a Base64-encoded string and then pass it in, which is suitable for scenarios where the image cannot be accessed via a public network URL. The size of the converted Base64-encoded string cannot exceed 50 MB.

#### OpenAI API

<div className='mdx-highlight'>

Please include the prefix before Base64 encoding:`data:{MIME_TYPE};base64,$BASE64_IMAGE`
- `{MIME_TYPE}`: The MIME type (media type) of the image, used to identify the image format, needs to be replaced with the MIME value corresponding to the actual image.
- `$BASE64_IMAGE`: A pure Base64-encoded string of the image file (without any prefix).

### Multi-image Input

Supports simultaneously passing in public network URLs or Base64-encoded strings of multiple images, and the model can parse the image content and return responses that match the image semantics.

## Image Restrictions

- Image Formats: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, BMP. 

- Image Size: 

   - When passed in as a URL: single imagefile sizedoes not exceed 50 MB.

   - When passed in as Base64 encoding: The size of the Base64 encoded string of a single image does not exceed 50 MB. 

- Number of images: When multiple images are passed in, the number of images is limited by the model's context length, and the total number of Tokens for all images and text must be less than the model's context length.

> Note: For calculating image tokens, please refer to [Explanation of Image Token Usage](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/docs/usage-guide/multimodal-understanding/image-understanding?target=explanation-of-image-token-usage-and-scaling-rules). For the model context length, please refer to [Pricing and Rate Limits](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/docs/pricing). 

## Explanation of Image Token Usage and Scaling Rules

The calculation rules for images are relatively complex. For Token conversion and scaling rules, please refer to the following code. The estimated results are for reference only, and the actual usage shall be subject to the API response. 

```python
import math
from PIL import Image

PATCH_SIZE = 16
SPATIAL_MERGE_SIZE = 2
TEMPORAL_PATCH_SIZE = 2
IMAGE_MIN_PIXELS = 8192
IMAGE_MAX_PIXELS = 8388608

def calc_image_tokens(image_path: str) -> dict:
    image = Image.open(image_path)
    height = image.height
    width = image.width

    factor = PATCH_SIZE * SPATIAL_MERGE_SIZE  # 32

    h_bar = round(height / factor) * factor
    w_bar = round(width / factor) * factor

    if h_bar * w_bar > IMAGE_MAX_PIXELS:
        beta = math.sqrt((height * width) / IMAGE_MAX_PIXELS)
        h_bar = math.floor(height / beta / factor) * factor
        w_bar = math.floor(width / beta / factor) * factor
    elif h_bar * w_bar < IMAGE_MIN_PIXELS:
        beta = math.sqrt(IMAGE_MIN_PIXELS / (height * width))
        h_bar = math.ceil(height / beta / factor) * factor
        w_bar = math.ceil(width / beta / factor) * factor

    grid_t = 1
    grid_h = h_bar // PATCH_SIZE
    grid_w = w_bar // PATCH_SIZE
    num_tokens = (grid_t * grid_h * grid_w) // (SPATIAL_MERGE_SIZE ** 2)
    return num_tokens

if __name__ == "__main__":
   token = calc_image_tokens(image_path="xxx/test.jpg")
   print(token)
```

## Price

- Billing: Total cost is calculated based on the number of input, input (cache hits), and output tokens; for pricing, please refer to [Pricing and Rate Limits](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/docs/pricing). 

   - The Token consumption of images can be calculated through [Explanation of Image Token Usage](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/docs/usage-guide/multimodal-understanding/image-understanding?target=explanation-of-image-token-usage-and-scaling-rules). The estimated results are for reference only, and the actual usage shall be subject to the API response. 

- View Bill: You can view your bill and usage on the [Billing](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/console/usage) page in the Console. 

## FAQ

### Does it support local file upload?

`mimo-v2.5` and `mimo-v2-omni` models do not currently support uploading local image files. For supported upload methods, please refer to [Image Input Method](https://platform.xiaomimimo.com/#/docs/usage-guide/multimodal-understanding/image-understanding?target=image-input-method).
